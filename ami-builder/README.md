# Packer AMI Builder ‚Äì Tomcat + Maven + Java Setup

The resulting AMI includes Java (configured as `JAVA_HOME`), Apache Tomcat, Maven, AWS CLI, and all necessary system-level configurations for secure and scalable Java application deployments.

Additionally, this setup includes IAM role and instance profile creation code required by Packer for secure EC2 access during the build process.
